`Stylisation on demand.`

# First off...
## What is this?
Colorboy is a small collection of image effects that allow for easy stylisation of your projects in Unity.

## How do I use Colorboy?
Simply import the UnityPackage from the releases tab and add one of the components onto your camera.

## The components.
### Colorboy
For changing color palettes.

## Future plans
I really enjoyed working on this project, especially since, being a programmer, I am not that great at creating great visuals for games. This tool really simplified making stuff look good for me. I will definitely keep working on it into the future.

## Last but not least...
I hope you'll have fun playing with this. Peace out‚úåüèª!
